# Pig_Latin
This program takes a sentence and translates it to pig latin. 
I created this program as a part of a school assignment. 
The rules of the translation were determined by my professor. 
The rules are as followe:
word ends in a constant, add way to the end
word ends in a vowel, move vowel to the front and add ay to the end
word is ony one letter, add way to the end
